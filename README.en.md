<h2>Z8 Group Research</h2>
This project includes code snippets that perform the operations of determining the elements of the Z8 cyclic group according to the addition operation and evaluating whether it conforms to the ultra-group homomorphism rules.
<h3>Code contents</h3>
<p>Functions and operations are gathered in the islemler.py file.</p>
<p>The operations required for querying Sub Ultra Groups are defined in the normal_alt_ultra.py file.</p>
<p>Setting and combining the groups required for the process is done in the application.py file.</p>
<p>The function required to examine group homomorphism among M sets is defined with key and value pair using dictionary structure.</p>
<p>M clusters are defined in the application.py file.</p>
<h3>Operating method</h3>
<p>Run the z8.py file for the table of group elements and their totals.</p>
<p>The application.py file is run for Ultra Group Homomorphism operations.</p>
